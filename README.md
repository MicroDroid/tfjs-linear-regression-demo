Linear Regression Demo (Tensorflow.js)
==========

This is a Stochastic Linear Regression implementation using Tensorflow.js which runs in the browser.

[See demo](https://overcoder.dev/tfjs-linear-regression-demo/)

### Project structure

- `app/` contains the entire web app
	- `js/` JavaScript code. Here you find the Linear Regression code.
	- `csv/` Datasets. Minified and original.
	- `scss/` Probably not what you're looking for here.

- `public/` contains compiled web app (after running Webpack)

### Running locally

```bash
